    API_DESCRIPTION: str = """ Project API is like a proxy to launch celery tasks and to query PostgreSQL ðŸš€ 

## API Features

- Produce celery tasks ;
- Produce celery worflow ;
- Query PostgreSQL Database ;
- Retrieve celery results synchronously and asynchronously;

### What is usefull with this software architecture ?

- API and workers are separated (The API couldn't be overloaded easily this way) ;
- Celery allow to distribute work by using canvas, which is usefull for heavy process ;
- Celery (through rabbitMQ) is connected to prometheus, which enable to autoscale workers on queue length ;
- Celery is helpful to distribute heavy process or launch background tasks.

### What is paintfull with this software architecture ?

- Celery is not optimized for small job.

### How about the global architecture  ?

The project is separated in 2 parts :
- project-api
- project-worker

#### project-api :

The API is dedicated for input data validation and tasks production.
- Celery is not natively compatible with asyncio, then the common celery functions are wrapped in **app/core/celery/async_celery.py** to keep the API full async ;
- Mapping celery tasks and fastapi endpoints is done in **/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/celery_worker.py** (1 **.py** file for each specific worker project) ;
- Examples of celery workflows are available in **/app/celery_workflows.py** and their endpoints are in **/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/celery_workflows.py** ;
- 1 celery task = 1 endpoint
- 1 workflow = 1 endpoint

#### project-worker :
The Celery worker project is dedicated to process tasks.
- Each celery-worker manage its own distribution and concurrency ;
- The queue consumed by a celery worker has to be the same as the endpoints queue (use to produce tasks) ; 
- Isolate queue = Isolate project ;
- You could use prometheus and rabbitMQ metrics exporter to manage auto-scaling on queue length.
